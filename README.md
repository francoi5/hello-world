             HELLO WORLD
========================================

This "hello-world" repository (repo) will be a place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others

A repo is used to organize a single project

Repos can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and datasets - anything a project needs

NOTE: It should include a README file, or a file with information about your project...gitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repo :)

It also offers other common options such as a license file.
